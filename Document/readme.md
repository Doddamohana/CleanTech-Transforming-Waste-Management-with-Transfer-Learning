                           REPORT
Clean tech is lever againg transfer learing in waste management to enhance efficiency and sustainability.By applying pre-trained models and adapting them to specific waste management tasks clean tech can improve waste classification,sorting ,and recycling processes. This approach,particularly using deep learing models like mobilnet V2 with attention mechanisma and PCAfor dimensionality reduction ,allows for real-time processing on edge devices with high accuracy.
        Improved waste classification:
              Transfer learing allows for the efficient classification of different waste types ( plastic,paper,glass) using
          Per-traing models like mobile netV2,with ca be fine tuned for waste-specific needs.
      Enhanced recycling processes:
               By accurately identifying rdcyclable materials transfer learing can streamline sorting and recycling    
          processes maximizing the recovery of valuable resources.
      Real-time processing on edge devices:
                The use of techniques like PCA to reduce the dimensionality of data enables transfer learing models to run efficiently on edge device facilitating real-time waste management solutions.
        Predictive waste management:
                 Using transfer learing to analyze waste generation patterns and predict waste volumes enabling proactive waste management strategies.
